# Native Facebook Login With Meteor & Cordova

This is a demonstration to show a bug in Meteor 1.0-rc.9, see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/meteor-talk/qkOIHqA-roI) on [meteor-talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-talk).

## Installation

Just clone this repository, change the `APP\_ID` and `APP\_NAME` in **mobile-config.js** to
the corresponding values of a Facebook app you own. (You can create one
[here](https://developers.facebook.com/))

Afterwards, you can run the app with `meteor run ios`.
